## Description

A View collects node children, aggregates specific events of all children, and rebroadcasts the aggregated events. When a UI element within a View broadcasts an event, two events are sent: the first one from the child and the second one from the group. Use View if you want to trigger event logic when a child node broadcasts an event, or if you want to know an event occurred within the group.

## Example

```javascript
<View />
```
