## Description
The PageView component is used to switch between displaying individual page node hierarchies. Use the PageView component to toggle between individual page node hierarchies. By default, the width and height of the PageView is `0` to allow the page view to expand to fit the content. You can constrain one or both values. There is no padding for views by default. Unless otherwise set, all pages within the view are aligned to the top left.

## Example

```javascript
<PageView />
```
