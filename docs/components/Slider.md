## Description
The Slider component places a slider into your prism. Use sliders to provide a visual reference to a specific range and the current value within that range, like a volume slider. You can create two types of sliders: horizontal and radial. Horizontal sliders can use either icons or labels. Radial sliders must use icons. The default slider is white and uses 100% opacity for the active part of the slider. Sliders inherit the width from a parent component, such as `RectLayout`. If the slider does not have a parent, it is one meter wide unless otherwise constrained. The default minimum and maximum values in the range are `0` and `1`.

## Example

```javascript
<Slider />
```
