<PlatformTabs component='line' />â€‹

## Description

The Line component renders a colored line. The Line component creates lines as a series of line segments. Line follows the order in which the points are added, and must have at least two points. Line color is a multiplier to the vertex color. Create disconnected lines by adding line breaks to the Line.

## Example

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { View, Line } from "magic-script-components";

export default class MyApp extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const points = [
      [-0.35, -0.35, -0.2],
      [0.35, 0.35, 0.2],
      [-0.35, -0.35, 0.2],
      [-0.35, 0.35, -0.2],
      [0.35, -0.35, 0.2],
      [-0.35, -0.35, -0.2]
    ];

    return (
      <View name="main-view">
        <Line points={points} color={[0.5, 1.0, 0.25, 0.8]} />
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
